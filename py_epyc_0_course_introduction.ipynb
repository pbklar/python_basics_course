    "## 0.3 Python Syntax: *Talking* to computers\n",
    "Syntax describes how Python code must be written so that the computer understands it. Learning the syntax of Python is like learning a language in which commmunication with the computer (in this case with the Python interpreter) is possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can do certain tasks so much better than humans (e.g. calculations), and are absolutely stupid with regard to many other things. In the 21st century programs, search engines, and digital assistants etc. have become much better at understanding humans. If you google \"3+5\" or \"three plus five\", you get in both cases the answer 8. Google understands both inputs because in the background there is a very complex program that tries to interpret the input. This program is quite good at understanding human input and translating it into machine language, which finally is translated back into an output that a human can understand. Thus, it adapts to human communication. We all know that the meaning of a spoken sentence depends on many factors (who says it, how is it said, to whom, why, in which context, irony, etc.). The sentence \"I will be there in 5 minutes.\" can mean very different things. \"Yes\" can mean many different things. \"No\" can man many different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is fully deterministic and therefore follows a strictly defined language. This is called *syntax*. If we do not follow the rules of the syntax, then the communication fails. If the used syntax is not understood, we will see an error message and the program is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.0 Example with correct syntax: the print function\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to print out something on the screen using the print function, the syntax must follow some rules:\n",
    "- *print* is written in lowercase letters.\n",
    "- The argument, that we want to print, is after an opening round bracket *(* and before a closing round bracket *)*\n",
    "- There may be 1 or more arguments. There must be a comma between arguments.\n",
    "- Additional blank spaces are allowed before and after the brackets\n",
    "- Within the brackets, also new lines are allowed. A line break between the *print* and the bracket is not allowed.\n",
    "- There is no other function call in the same line of the closing bracket. The expression ends after the closing bracket *)*."
