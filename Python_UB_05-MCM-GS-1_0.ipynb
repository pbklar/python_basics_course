    "When you read this you have a running Jupyter notebook system, most likely from the *jupyterhub* offered by the Universit√§t Bremen. We will will work almost exclusively with this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, code can be executed on your own laptop/PC/mobile phone etc. or on a server. **It is recommended to use either *jupyterhub* from the server or to use an installation on your own laptop**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A description how to install Python was provided via *Stud.IP*. If you have Python (or Anaconda/miniconda) installed locally on your device, feel free to use your own installation. In principle, there are also public Jupyter notebook servers and terminals (e.g. https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/), but its use is **not recommended** (slow execution, sometimes no execution at all, how do you save files? guaranteed access in the future?).\n",

Students are expected to watch, listen, type, and execute the input as demonstrated by the lecturer. The student's notebook should be more or less look identical to what is shown on the big screen. **If there are problems of any kind (lecturer is too fast, unexpected output, questions in general), please raise your hand!**\n",

Students are expected to provide an answer, which typically consists of a few lines of Python code. In all cases, there will be several correct solutions.

If the exercise comes up during the class, students will usually have a couple of minutes to work on it before a solution is presented by the lecturer.\n",

    "## 0.3 Python Syntax: *Talking* to computers\n",
    "Syntax describes how Python code must be written so that the computer understands it. Learning the syntax of Python is like learning a language in which commmunication with the computer (in this case with the Python interpreter) is possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can do certain tasks so much better than humans do (e.g. calculations), and are absolutely stupid with regard to many other things. In the 21st century programs, search engines, and digital assistants etc. have become much better at understanding humans. If you google \"3+5\" or \"three plus five\", you get in both cases the answer 8. Google understands both inputs because in the background there is a very complex program running that tries to interpret the input. This program is quite good at understanding human input and translating it into machine language, which finally is translated back into an input a human can understand. Thus, it adapts to human communication. We all know that the meaning of a spoken sentence depends on many factors (who says it, how is it said, to whom, why, in which context, irony, etc.). The sentence \"I will be there in 5 minutes.\" can mean very different things. \"Yes\" can mean many different things. \"No\" can man many different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is fully deterministic and therefore very strict in terms of how the communication is defined. This is called *syntax*. If we do not follow the rules of the syntax, then the communication fails. If the used syntax is not understood, we will see an error message and the program is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3.0 Example with correct syntax: the print command\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to print out something on the screen using the print command, the syntax must follow some rules:\n",
    "- *print* is written in lowercase letters.\n",
    "- The argument, that we want to print, is after an opening round bracket *(* and before a closing round bracket *)*\n",
    "- There may be 1 or more arguments. There must be a comma between arguments.\n",
    "- Additional blank spaces are allowed before and after the brackets\n",
    "- Within the brackets, also new lines are allowed.\n",
    "- There is no other command in the same line of the closing bracket."
